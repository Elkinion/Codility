You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

    n=len(A)
    result=[n]*n
    count={}
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i] in count:
            count[A[i]]+=1
        else:
            count[A[i]]=1
    previous={}
    for i in range(n):
        if (A[i]-1) in previous:
            result[i]=previous[A[i]-1]
            next
        else:
            sqrt=int(A[i]**(1/2))
            for j in range(1,sqrt+1):

                    if j**2==A[i]:
                        if j in count:
                            result[i]-=count[j]

                            result[i]-=count[j]
                        if A[i]//j in count:
                            result[i]-=count[A[i]//j]
